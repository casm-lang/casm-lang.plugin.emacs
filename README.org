* casm-lang.plugin.emacs

=emacs= syntax highlighting for the CASM language.
 
** How to use it?

Just clone the repository to a local location and copy the following code snippet into your =emacs= initialization file, which is located by default at =~/.emacs= or =~/.emacs.d/init.el=. 
This snippet just loads the provided =casm-mode.el= syntax configuration file and sets an automatic load function for the major editing mode for files with a =.casm= file extension.  

#+begin_src elisp

(load "<PATH-TO_REPO>/casm-mode.el")
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.casm\\'" . casm-mode))

#+end_src
